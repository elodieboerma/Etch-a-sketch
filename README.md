# Etch-a-sketch
This project utilizes DOM manipulation skills to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project is difficult and requires frequent use of Google to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use, although it could be built using the tools already learned up to this point in TOP. TOP gave the basic steps, but I got to decide how to implement them.
